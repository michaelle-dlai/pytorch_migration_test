    "So far, you've worked with small, manually created tensors. This time, you'll level up by loading a larger dataset from a `.csv` file, a common first step in any machine learning task. This problem is also more complex: instead of a single input predicting an outcome, you'll have **multiple features** that all work together to influence the final delivery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment also introduces you to one of the most creative and impactful parts of machine learning: **feature engineering**. You'll get to write a function that creates a completely new feature from the existing data. Designing features like this is an important skill that allows you to build more powerful and insightful models.\n",

    "**What You'll Do in This Assignment**\n",

    "* Prepare the multi feature dataset using normalization and advanced tensor manipulations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of hoping the model learns this complex pattern on its own, you can use **feature engineering**. This is a creative step where you apply domain knowledge to make these patterns explicit. You will engineer a new feature that directly tells the model when a delivery falls within a rush hour window.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This new feature will be `1` if a delivery was dispatched during the morning rush `(8:00 - 10:00 AM)` or the evening rush `(4:00 - 7:00 PM / 16:00 - 19:00)` on a weekday, and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might wonder why rush hour is only being considered on weekdays? This reflects a common real world pattern. The concept of a \"rush hour\" is traditionally tied to weekday commuter traffic, which is the pattern that most predictably impacts delivery times on a city wide scale. This specific pattern disappears on weekends.\n",
    "Therefore, it's a realistic assumption to make that the primary driver of rush hour delays is the weekday commute.\n",
