    "You have already trained many models; now it is time to shape one for life outside a notebook. This lab guides you through taking a pre-trained VGG16 based StreetClassifier and turning it into a version that is easier to store, faster on CPU, and ready for deployment on edge targets. Along the way you will practice saving and reloading model state, pruning parameters, applying quantization, and evaluating the trade offs among accuracy, latency, and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the CleanStreetDataset, initialize a pre-trained StreetClassifier, and establish a baseline evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with checkpoints by saving and restoring state_dict objects for both training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement magnitude based pruning across convolutional and linear layers, with options for unstructured and structured strategies, and verify sparsity and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply dynamic quantization to linear layers for a fast CPU speedup and benchmark the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fuse common layer patterns and prepare a quantization aware variant, fine tune briefly, then convert to an int8 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare accuracy, inference time, and file size before and after compression to understand the impact of each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you will have a compact classifier that keeps performance close to the original while being far more efficient to run and ship."

    "\n",
    "Now you will implement the function `prune_model`, which applies pruning to all `Conv2d` and `Linear` layers in the **StreetClassifier** model.  \n",
    "You can choose between two pruning modes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`l1_unstructured`** – removes a fraction of the smallest-magnitude weights.  \n",
    "- **`ln_structured`** – removes entire output channels (structured pruning), which can lead to faster inference on some hardware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Prune a Model?\n",
    "- **Smaller models** → reduced memory footprint and easier deployment on resource-constrained devices.  \n",
    "- **Faster inference** → especially with structured pruning, which eliminates entire channels.  \n",
    "- **Regularization effect** → pruning can sometimes improve generalization by removing redundant connections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### prune_model -- details\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement ```prune_model(model, amount=0.3, mode=\"l1_unstructured\")```, a function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Applies magnitude-based pruning to the weights of every nn.Conv2d and nn.Linear layer in a given model using PyTorch’s pruning reparametrization API. The pruning is applied in-place (adds weight_orig and weight_mask) and does not change any tensor shapes. To permanently bake zeros into the stored weights (remove reparametrization), a separate helper finalize_pruning(model) is provided for you to call afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function proceeds through these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate Inputs\n",

    "2. Ensure mode is one of {\"l1_unstructured\", \"ln_structured\"}.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find Prunable Modules\n",
    "    - Iterate over the model and select only ```nn.Conv2d``` and ```nn.Linear``` layers (a helper _iter_prunable_modules(model) is available).\n",
    "    - Skip any module that does not have a weight attribute.\n",
    "4. Apply Pruning (In-Place Reparametrization)\n",
    "     - For unstructured pruning (default): Use ```prune.l1_unstructured(module, name=\"weight\", amount=amount)``` to zero the smallest-magnitude individual weights within each tensor.\n",
    "     - For structured pruning: Use ```prune.ln_structured(module, name=\"weight\", amount=amount, n=2, dim=0)``` to zero out entire output channels (L2-norm across channel filters), leaving tensor shapes unchanged but producing channel-wise sparsity masks.\n",
    "5. Return the Same Model Instance\n",
    "Return the input model with pruning reparametrization attached (i.e., weight becomes a computed tensor from weight_orig * weight_mask).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Parameters and buffers now include weight_orig and weight_mask for pruned layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downstream code can call ```finalize_pruning(model)``` to remove the reparametrization objects and write the masked values into the raw weight tensors.\n",

    "\n",
    "The output of this function—a model with pruning masks attached—will later be used by grading code that (a) checks the presence of reparametrized weights, (b) inspects sparsity levels, and (c) optionally calls finalize_pruning(model) before export or quantization.\n",

    "### Quantization in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization is a technique that reduces the **precision** of model weights and activations, typically converting them from 32-bit floating point (FP32) to lower-precision formats like 8-bit integers (INT8).  \n",
    "This can drastically reduce the size of the model and improve inference speed, especially on CPUs and edge devices, while keeping accuracy close to that of the original FP32 model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smaller model size** → INT8 weights require 4× less storage than FP32.  \n",
    "- **Faster inference** → Integer operations are usually faster than floating-point on CPUs.  \n",
    "- **Lower memory bandwidth** → Reduced precision means less data transfer, improving latency.  \n",
    "- **Deployment-friendly** → Ideal for running models on devices with limited resources (mobile, IoT, embedded).  \n",

    "---\n",

    "### Dynamic Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to quantization:  \n",
    "- **Static Quantization**: requires calibration with representative data before inference.  \n",
    "- **Quantization Aware Training (QAT)**: simulates quantization effects during training for maximum accuracy retention.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Quantization**: the simplest approach — it keeps weights in INT8 but performs activations in FP32, dynamically quantizing them at runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic quantization is particularly effective for models dominated by `nn.Linear` layers (e.g., Transformers, LSTMs, fully-connected classifiers).**  \n",
    "It requires **no retraining or calibration** and is CPU-only, making it the fastest way to get the benefits of quantization.  \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Apply dynamic INT8 quantization to nn.Linear only\n",
    "    - Use torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(...) on the FP32 copy.\n",
    "    - Pass the module set {nn.Linear} so only linear layers are quantized.\n",

    "\n",
    "Implement `prepare_qat(model, backend=\"fbgemm\")`, a function that: returns a QAT-ready copy of an FP32 model by selecting an appropriate quantized backend, fusing eligible blocks (e.g., `Conv+BN(+ReLU)`), attaching a default QAT qconfig, and running eager-mode prepare_qat to insert observers and fake-quant modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** The original model must remain unmodified; the returned module must be in train() mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function has the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone & Switch to Train Mode (No Mutation)\n",
    "    - Create a deep copy of the input model so the original remains intact.\n",
    "    - Put the copy in training mode: .train() (QAT requires training mode).\n",
    "2. Select Quantized Backend\n",
    "    - Set torch.backends.quantized.engine to the requested backend if available.\n",
    "    - Defaults: \"fbgemm\" (x86) or \"qnnpack\" (ARM).\n",
    "    - If unsupported, keep the runtime’s current engine (best-effort).\n",
    "3. Fuse Eligible Modules (Best-Effort)\n",
    "    - Call the created helper fuse_model_inplace(qat) to fuse common patterns like (Conv, BN, ReLU), (Conv, BN), (Conv, ReLU), (Linear, ReLU).\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Insert Observers & Fake-Quant (Eager QAT Prepare)\n",
    "    - Call aoq.prepare_qat(qat, inplace=True) to add observers and fake-quant modules throughout the network.\n",
    "    - These modules simulate quantization effects during training.\n",
    "    - Ensure the returned module is in train() mode and ready for QAT fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the new (deep-copied) QAT-ready model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this function—a QAT-ready model—will then be fine-tuned for a few epochs. During training, the inserted observers and fake-quantization modules learn appropriate scales/zero-points, enabling a high-accuracy post-training convert to INT8 later.\n",

    "You started from a solid baseline and made it deployable. By saving and reloading state dictionaries you protected your progress and created a repeatable path back to working models. With pruning you explored how zeroing less useful parameters can make a network leaner, and you saw how masks change behavior without immediately changing tensor shapes. Dynamic quantization gave you a rapid path to smaller weights and faster CPU inference, and the fusion plus quantization aware training workflow helped you fine tune under simulated int8 effects so the final converted model holds onto accuracy while gaining speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a StreetClassifier that is lighter, faster, and easier to package. The same workflow scales to larger architectures and different tasks: prune with intent, quantify the accuracy and latency impact, and then use quantization aware training when you want the best balance. As next steps, you can automate experiment tracking, prune with channel removal to alter layer shapes, or export to formats that run beyond PyTorch so your models serve users wherever they live."
